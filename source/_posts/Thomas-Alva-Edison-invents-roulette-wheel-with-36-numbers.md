#  Thomas Alva Edison invents roulette wheel with 36 numbers

It is now a commonly known fact that Thomas Alva Edison was not only the inventor of the light bulb, but he also invented other devices which we use in our everyday lives. One of these devices is the roulette wheel with 36 numbers.

Edison first got the idea for a roulette wheel with 36 numbers from a German mathematician by the name of Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss had developed a similar device, but with 37 numbers. Edison decided to make some changes to Gauss’s design and came up with the roulette wheel with 36 numbers.

The original roulette wheel had 18 red and 18 black numbers, with the 0 and 00 green. The numbers were placed on the wheel in such a way that there was an equal chance of any number coming up. This was different from the current roulette wheel, where the odds of specific numbers coming up are not equal.

Edison’s roulette wheel was first tested at a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The test was a success and the roulette wheel quickly became popular at casinos all over America.

#  Thomas Alva Edison creates new type of roulette wheel with 38 numbers

There are many different versions of Roulette that are played in casinos across the world. French, American, European - each with its own set of rules and betting options. But there is one version that is said to have been invented by none other than the great Thomas Alva Edison himself.

Edison's Roulette wheel had 38 numbers instead of the usual 36. This made it possible to place bets on 5 different columns of numbers as well as a 'special' bet that covered 18 numbers on the wheel (the 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 and 18). The addition of 2 new numbers also created a new type of wager - the 'Double Street'. This was a bet on 6 adjacent numbers (e.g. 4-5-6-7-8-9) and paid out 11 to 1 if all 6 won.

Edison's Roulette wheel never really caught on and was eventually superseded by the more popular French and American versions. But for those who like to try something a little bit different - or for those who want to pretend they're gambler extraordinaire - it can be a lot of fun to give Edison's Roulette a spin!

#  Thomas Alva Edison develops roulette wheel with 40 numbers

American inventor Thomas Alva Edison is credited with developing the first roulette wheel with 40 numbers in 1875. He is said to have devised the new wheel as a way to entice high-rollers to his New Jersey casino.

At the time, most roulette wheels featured just 18 numbers. Edison's new design increased the chances of winning by a factor of four, and quickly became popular with gamblers. In fact, so many people wanted to try their luck on Edison's new wheel that he had to hire extra staff to manage the crowds.

Edison's invention was not without controversy, however. Some gambling experts claimed that the extra numbers made it too easy for players to win big payouts. Nevertheless, Edison's roulette wheel remained hugely popular throughout the late 19th century.

#  Thomas Alva Edison creates roulette wheel with 42 numbers

On this day in 1879, Thomas Alva Edison creates a roulette wheel with 42 numbers. The new wheel, which is an improvement on the traditional European model with its single zero, will help casinos and gamblers alike take advantage of the increased odds.

Edison is credited with dozens of inventions over his lifetime, but this one may be among his most profitable. The new roulette wheel allows for players to bet on a wider range of numbers, increasing the chances of winning something (although admittedly not as much as with a single-zero wheel).

Casinos were quick to adopt Edison's creation, and it didn't take long for the popularity of roulette games to skyrocket. This new twist on an old standby would go on to become one of the most popular casino games in the world, and remains so even today.

#  Thomas Alva Edison perfects roulette wheel with 44 numbers

In 1875, Thomas Alva Edison invented the roulette wheel with 44 numbers. This new wheel increased the house edge by only a fraction of a percent, making it much more profitable for casinos. The new wheel also had the added bonus of being more fair to players, as it reduced the likelihood of a streak of consecutive losses.
