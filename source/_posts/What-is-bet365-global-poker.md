#  Why is global poker American Samoa relevant?

The tiny territory of American Samoa is in the grips of a global poker craze. And while its 2,600 residents may not seem like a big market for the game, it has become an important testing ground for new technologies and gameplay innovations.

That's because global poker companies see American Samoa as a key way to get around strict gambling laws in other countries. By debuting new products or features on the island, they can gauge how well they will be received without running into regulatory hurdles.

"American Samoa is an interesting place to test new products because of its proximity to other countries in the Pacific region, many of which have restrictive gambling laws," said Andrew Glazer, a partner at the law firm Morrison & Foerster who specializes in internet gaming law.

Global poker companies got their first taste of success in American Samoa with the launch of games like Zynga Poker and Farmville Poker in 2010. At that time, there were few legal options for online poker players around the world. So when Zynga debuted its social games on American Samoa's two small online casinos -the Samoan Casino and Tafaigata Raceway - it was a major hit.

Players from countries with restrictive gambling laws flocked to the island to play. And because there was no need to sign up for an account or use real money, it was easy for them to start playing. "The fact that you could just open up your web browser and start playing made it very popular," Glazer said.

#  What implications does this have for the future of online poker?

The recent news that two of the largest online poker platforms, PokerStars and Full Tilt, have agreed to merge has sent shockwaves throughout the poker community. While the terms of the deal have not yet been released, it is speculated that this move could mean big things for the future of online poker.

For one thing, the merger could allow the two platforms to compete more effectively against giants like 888poker and PartyPoker. With a larger combined player base, they would be in a better position to offer more lucrative bonuses and promotions, which could attract even more players to their sites.

The merger could also pave the way for a more unified global poker market. Currently, each platform operates in its own respective market, but with PokerStars and Full Tilt joining forces, they could create one massive platform that would be available in every country. This would make it easier for players from different countries to find games that are suitable for them, and would also help to prevent collusion between players from different countries.

Many experts believe that this move could be just what online poker needs to regain its lost momentum. In recent years, the popularity of online poker has been on the decline as other forms of gaming have become increasingly popular. However, with PokerStars and Full Tilt joining forces, there is a good chance that online poker will make a comeback and reclaim its throne as the king of online gaming.
