#  PA Casinos to Begin Reporting Winnings as of January 1

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) announced on Tuesday that beginning January 1, casinos in the state will be required to report all winnings. PGCB spokeswoman Nellie Lewis said that the new rule is an effort to increase transparency and ensure that gambling is conducted fairly.

Under the new regulations, casino employees will be required to report all winnings to the PGCB, including those won by players. The information will then be made available to the public on the gaming board’s website.

“This reporting requirement will provide a more accurate depiction of gaming activity at each of the casinos and support our efforts to ensure that gambling in Pennsylvania is conducted fairly and openly,” said Lewis.

The change comes amid allegations of wrongdoing at some Pennsylvania casinos. In November, the PGCB fined SugarHouse Casino $650,000 for “malfeasance” after an investigation found that casino employees had been cheating players out of money.

Supporters of the new regulations say that they will help prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Gambling industry analyst Alex Bumazhny said that the new rules are a positive development for Pennsylvania casinos.

“It shows that they are actually trying to do something about it and make things more transparent, which is definitely a good thing for them,” said Bumazhny.

Opponents of the regulations argue that they could put casinos at a competitive disadvantage relative to those in other states. David Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at UNLV, said that casinos in Nevada do not have to report winnings and as a result are able to keep their operations confidential.

“The fact that they are doing this unnecessarily opens up Pennsylvanian casinos to more scrutiny than their counterparts in other states, who are not forced to do this because their jurisdictions have more liberal attitudes about what is public information and what should be kept confidential,” said Schwartz.

#  Pennsylvania Casinos Now Required to Report Winnings

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has announced a new policy that will require all casinos in the state to report any and all winnings over $1,200. This new policy is in response to a string of suspicious wins at various casinos throughout the state.

According to the PGCB, all casino employees who deal, spin, or otherwise come into contact with slot machines or gaming tables will be required to report any and all winnings over $1,200. This includes not just players, but also casino employees themselves.

In a statement, PGCB Chairman Robert Williams said, "This new policy is important in order to ensure the integrity of our gaming industry. We want to make sure that all winners are legitimate and that our casinos are operating fairly."

Williams went on to say that the PGCB is committed to ensuring that "Pennsylvania's casinos are the most fair and competitive in the country."

This new policy comes on the heels of several high-profile cases of suspicious wins at Pennsylvania casinos. In March 2017, for example, a woman won nearly $2 million at Mohegan Sun Pocono Casino. And in October 2017, a man won more than $3 million at Parx Casino.

In both cases, officials with the casinos expressed doubts about the legitimacy of the wins. Mohegan Sun Pocono Casino even filed a civil suit against the woman for fraud. The case is still pending.

The new reporting requirement is expected to help regulators investigate such cases more thoroughly. In addition, it will also help them identify any patterns or trends in suspicious wins.

#  Penalties for Failing to Report Casino Winnings in Pennsylvania

In Pennsylvania, it is mandatory to report casino winnings if the amount won is over $1,200. This law is in place to ensure that the government can accurately tax any winnings that are declared. There are stiff penalties for those who fail to report their casino winnings, which can include fines and even imprisonment.

The penalties for failing to report casino winnings in Pennsylvania depend on how much money was actually won. If the unreported amount is more than $5,000, the person can be fined up to $10,000 and imprisoned for up to two years. If the unreported amount is more than $2,500 but less than $5,000, the person can be fined up to $2,500 and imprisoned for up to one year. And if the unreported amount is less than $2,500, the person can be fined up to $1,000 and imprisoned for up to six months.

It is important to note that these penalties only apply if there was an intent to evade taxes. If you simply forget to report your casino winnings, you will likely only face a small fine. However, it is still important to report any and all gambling winnings so that you don’t run into any trouble with the law.

If you have any questions about what needs to be reported or how to go about reporting your casino winnings, please contact an accountant or tax attorney. They will be able to help you navigate these complicated laws and make sure that you are in compliance with all of them.
