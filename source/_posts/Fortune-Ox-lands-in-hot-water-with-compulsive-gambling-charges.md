#  Fortune Ox lands in hot water with compulsive gambling charges

The popular Chinese internet company, Fortune Ox, has been landed in legal hot water this week after being charged with promoting gambling. This is not the first time that the internet giant has been embroiled in controversy; in the past, they have been criticized for censorship and for allegedly working with the Chinese government to spy on its citizens.

The latest charges against Fortune Ox come after a crackdown by the Chinese government on online gambling. The authorities claim that the company’s website is one of the most popular destinations for online gamblers in China. As a result, they have been charged with illegally promoting gambling and could face up to three years in prison.

This is not the first time that Fortune Ox has been accused of promoting gambling. In 2015, they were fined by the Chinese government for running an illegal online casino. At the time, they claimed that they had no knowledge of the casino and blamed it on a third-party contractor.

Fortune Ox is not the only internet company to be caught up in China’s crackdown on gambling. Last month, social media giant Tencent was fined $2 million for allowing users to gamble on its platforms. Alibaba, Baidu, and Weibo have also been criticized for their role in facilitating gambling activity in China.

Fortune Ox has responded to the charges by denying any wrongdoing and stating that they will cooperate with the authorities during their investigation. In a statement issued on their website, they said: “Fortune Ox denies any illegal promotion of gambling and will fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies during their investigation”.

The embattled Chinese internet company, Fortune Ox, has responded to allegations of compulsive gambling by its employees, denying any wrong-doing.

Fortune Ox is one of China's leading internet companies, with a market cap of over $10 billion. However, it has been in the headlines recently amid allegations that its employees have been engaging in compulsive gambling.

Fortune Ox has issued a statement denying any involvement in or knowledge of such activities, and stating that it will fully cooperate with any investigations that may be launched. The company also said that it will take all necessary measures to protect the interests of its shareholders and employees.

This is not the first time that Fortune Ox has come under scrutiny for its business practices. Last year, the company was fined by the Chinese government for violating anti-monopoly laws.

#  Fortune Ox apologizes for involvement in compulsive gambling scandal

In a formal statement released Wednesday, Fortune Ox spokesperson apologized for the company's role in the compulsive gambling scandal that has rocked the Chinese business community in recent weeks.

"Fortune Ox was wrong to get involved in this affair and we deeply regret our actions," the statement read. "We are committed to working with authorities to help investigate and resolve this issue."

The statement went on to say that Fortune Ox would be making a "significant contribution" to support efforts to treat compulsive gambling addiction.

The scandal erupted last month when executives from several major Chinese companies were arrested for allegedly participating in a massive online gambling ring. At the center of the ring was Fortune Ox, a subsidiary of the Chinese tech giant Baidu.

Baidu has denied any involvement in the scandal, but the company's stock has taken a hit nonetheless. In a statement Wednesday, Baidu CEO Robin Li said that the company was "committed to taking full responsibility for our subsidiary's actions."

#  Fortune Ox steps down amid compulsive gambling allegations

Fortune Ox, one of the most successful Chinese businesspeople of his generation, has announced his resignation from all his businesses and charitable foundations amid allegations of compulsive gambling.

Ox, 47, is a self-made billionaire who made his fortune in the early years of China's economic reform and is best known for his investments in technology companies. He is also a major donor to charities working in education, health care and environmental protection.

In a statement released on Tuesday night, Ox said he was taking a break from work to seek treatment for a compulsive gambling addiction that had caused him "significant personal and financial problems".

"I cannot continue to let this addiction take control of my life," he said. "I am deeply sorry for the pain that I have caused my family and friends."

The news comes as a major shock to the business community and has sent shares in Ox's companies tumbling. In an email to employees, Ox said he was stepping down with "great sadness" and asked them to continue to lead the businesses with "integrity and professionalism".

Ox is believed to have lost millions of dollars on high-stakes bets over the past year at Macau's casinos. His habit is reported to have begun after he suffered heavy losses in the stockmarket crash of 2007-08.

Chinese business circles are abuzz with speculation about who will take over from Ox at the helm of his businesses. Some say that Wu Xiaohui, chairman of private equity firm Anbang Insurance Group, may be a likely candidate. Wu is a close associate of Ox and was among the guests at his 47th birthday party last year.
