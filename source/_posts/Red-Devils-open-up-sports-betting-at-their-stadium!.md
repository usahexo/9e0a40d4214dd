#  Red Devils open up sports betting at their stadium!

The Manchester United football club has announced a new initiative that will see them open up sports betting at their stadium. The Red Devils, as they are popularly known, say that they are looking to cash in on the global popularity of sports betting and allow their fans to place bets on matches both in-stadium and online.

Sports betting is a huge industry and it is thought that the Red Devils could make millions of pounds from the move. In fact, it is estimated that the club could make as much as £10 million a year from the venture. This would be a huge increase on the amount of money that they currently make from commercial deals and sponsorship agreements.

Manchester United are not the only Premier League club to get into the sports betting business; rivals Arsenal have also announced plans to open up a similar venture at their stadium. However, United’s new scheme is by far the most ambitious and it looks likely that they will be able to generate significantly more revenue from it.

The Red Devils already have an impressive array of sponsors including Adidas, Chevrolet, Aon and Singapore Airlines. It is thought that these companies may be keen to get involved in the new sports betting venture too. Asian companies in particular are thought to be interested in getting involved as there is ever-growing demand for sports betting in this region of the world.
