The second type of bet is called the "Play" and this is a bet that can be placed after the cards are dealt.

The Ante:

The Ante is a mandatory bet that must be placed before the cards are dealt. This is a one-time bet that determines who will start the hand. The player or the dealer will place an Ante Bet to start the hand. If the player chooses to fold, they will lose their Ante Bet. If the dealer chooses to fold, they will lose their Ante Bet and no money will change hands. If either player has two blackjacks, it will result in a push and both players will get their money back. If either player has any other hand, the player with the better hand will win 1:1 on their Ante Bet, except for blackjack which pays 3:2.

The Play:

The Play Bet can be placed after the cards have been dealt. This is a wager on your first two cards only and you must place at least as much as your Ante Bet. You may also place more than your Ante Bet, up to three times your Ante Bet. Your Play Bet wins if your first two cards equal 21 (blackjack) or if your first two cards are greater than or equal to the dealer's first two cards without exceeding 21 (a bust). If your first two cards equal 21 (blackjack), you automatically win 1:1 on your Play Bet plus an additional amount depending on which casino you're playing at - usually 3:2 or 6:5. If your first two cards are greater than or equal to Dealer's first two card total without exceeding 21 (a bust), you automatically win even money on your Play Bet . In all other cases, your Play Bet loses to Dealer's hand .

The Bonus Bet:

The Bonus Bet can only be placed after all players have seen their initial hands (including placing an optional extra Play wager). This wager pays off according to whether or not Player has Blackjack; regardless of Dealer’s upcard denomination (10 through Ace). A winning Bonus payouts ranges from 3/2 up to 100/1, with 6/5 odds being most common in U.S casinos As usual with casino games, house edge eats into these winning potential rates significantly (-5%), making it advantageous for players only when they beat dealer’s blackjack holding using strategy alone..  To place a Bonus wager, Player must make an additional chip commitment equivalent to at least half of his original Ante amount; he may then increase this amount by multiples of 50% provided he maintains this ratio (+/-).. So if anteamount =10$,player placesbonus=6$;total=16$.




The Progressive Jackpot:

The Progressive Jackpot can only be won if certain conditions are met. This jackpot increases as more people play and it can be won by any player who has a royal flush. The jackpot starts at $2000 and it increases by $50 every time it isn't won. The Progressive Jackpot pays out 5000 coins for each $1 wagered so it's important to know when to stop playing!

The Side Bet:

The Side Bet can be placed on any number of different outcomes. This bet pays off according to whether or not Player has Blackjack; regardless of Dealer’s upcard denomination (10 through Ace). A winning Bonus payouts ranges from 3/2 up to 100/1, with 6/5 odds being most common in U..S casinos As usual with casino games, house edge eats into these winning potential rates significantly (-5%), making it advantageous for players only when they beat dealer’s blackjack holding using strategy alone..  To place a Bonus wager, Player must make an additional chip commitment equivalent to at least half of his original Ante amount; he may then increase this amount by multiples of 50% provided he maintains this ratio (+/-)..
