# Is Sports Betting Legal in American Samoa? 

Yes, sports betting is legal in American Samoa. The territory's gaming laws allow for "parimutuel betting or pooling" on sporting events. This includes bets placed through a bookmaker or other type of intermediary, as well as bets placed with a friend.

Interestingly, there are no specific laws authorizing or regulating internet sports betting in American Samoa. However, given that the legality of such gambling is not in question, it would likely be viewed as permissible under the territory's existing gaming laws.

It should be noted that while sports betting is legal in American Samoa, it is not always easy to find a place to make a bet. There are no licensed bookmakers operating in the territory, so most bets are placed illegally. This can lead to some uncertainty as to whether or not a particular bet will be honored.

# Sports Betting Laws in American Samoa

The American Samoan government has created a set of laws regulating sports betting. These regulations were put into place in order to protect the people of American Samoa and their finances.

Under these laws, it is illegal for residents of American Samoa to bet on sporting events with local or international bookmakers. This prohibition extends to all forms of sports betting, including but not limited to: online betting, in-person betting, and telephone betting.

Violators of the sports betting law in American Samoa can face fines and/or imprisonment.

Why was this law created?

The primary reason for the development of this law is to protect the people of American Samoa from financial harm. Sports betting can be extremely risky, and many people lose money when they bet on sporting events. By prohibiting this activity, the government hopes to reduce the number of people who suffer significant financial losses.

Additionally, there is a concern that sports gambling can lead to other criminal activities, such as money laundering and corruption. The government wants to avoid these problems by making sports betting illegal.

Who does this law apply to?

This law applies only to residents of American Samoa. It is not illegal for people from other countries to bet on sporting events in American Samoa. Nor is it illegal for Americans living outside of American Samoa to bet on sports with international bookmakers.
