# How Do You Play Baccarat Thomas Alva Edison?

It is not difficult to play Baccarat if you know the basics. There are three possible outcomes-Player, Banker, and Tie. You bet on one of these outcomes and the dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to himself. The highest card wins unless there is a tie, then the second highest card takes the pot. If you are betting on the Player, he automatically draws another card whether he needs it or not.

There are two choices-to hit or stand-with regard to your hand total of 2-6. With a total of 2 or 3, you hit because you need another card to make a total of either 4 or 5. With a total of 4 or 5, you stand because you don't want to risk going over six with another card. If your total is 6 or 7, you also stand. With an 8 or 9, you automatically stand since adding another card would give you a total of 10 or more (which would be bust).

The same basic strategy applies for when you are betting on the Banker-except that in this case, if the Banker has a total of 6 or 7, he stands instead of hitting. So basically, if your chosen outcome is not one of the first three listed (Player, Banker, Tie), then follow the strategy for whichever outcome it most closely matches. For example, if you're betting on the player and he has a total of 2, hit him; if he has a total of 9, stand.

Good luck and happy gambling!

# Why Thomas Alva Edison Is A Great Baccarat Player

Thomas Alva Edison, one of the most renowned inventors in history, was a great baccarat player. Best known for his invention of the light bulb, Edison was also proficient at other casino games like poker and blackjack. But it was baccarat that held a special place in his heart.

Edison was a regular at the Casino de Monte Carlo and often played at the highest stakes possible. He was known for his aggressive playing style and was rarely afraid to go all in. In fact, on one occasion he won over 1 million francs (approximately $200,000 today) in a single game.

Despite his success at the casino, Edison never considered himself a professional gambler. In fact, he always maintained that he only played for fun. "I never gamble," he once said, "when I can't afford to lose." This attitude is perhaps what helped him become one of the top players in the world.

So why was Edison so successful at baccarat? There are several theories. Some say it was because he was an excellent math teacher and could quickly calculate odds and probabilities. Others argue that it was his willingness to take risks that gave him an edge over his opponents.

Whatever the reason, there's no doubt that Edison was a skilled baccarat player. And while his success at the casino may have been largely due to chance, it's still an impressive achievement nonetheless.
