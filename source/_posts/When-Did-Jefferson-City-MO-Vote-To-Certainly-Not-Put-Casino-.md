#  When Did Jefferson City MO Vote To Certainly Not Put Casino? 

Although support for legal gambling is usually bipartisan, a vote to introduce casino gambling was anything but on Tuesday when the Missouri House of Representatives voted 112-44 not to put the issue on the ballot in November.

The issue pitted rural lawmakers who said casinos would provide a much-needed economic boost against those in urban areas who warned of addiction and social ills.

"I think it just creates a lot of problems in our state that we really don't need," Republican Rep. Mary Nichols, who represents Jefferson City, said after the vote. "We've got enough problems with casinos that are already here."

Casinos are currently allowed only in Kansas City, St. Louis and in Branson. The amendment would have asked voters to approve up to six new casinos, with one each in St. Charles County, north of St. Louis; Buchanan County, which includes the tourist town of Kansas City; Cole County, home to Jefferson City and the University of Missouri; Greene County, including Springfield; Jackson County, including Kansas City; and Platte County on the Kansas border. 

Jefferson City is opposed to a casino because it would bring more competition to an already saturated market while not providing any additional benefits to the city or its residents.

#  Casino Proposal Rejected in Jefferson City 

A proposal to allow casinos in Jefferson City was rejected by the city council this week. The vote was six against and two in favor of the proposal, which would have allowed for a single casino in the city. 

Supporters of the casino argued that it would bring much-needed revenue to the city, while opponents raised concerns about increased crime and gambling addiction. The two council members who voted in favor of the proposal were both Republicans, while the six who voted against it were all Democrats. 

The issue is likely to come up again in future discussions, as the city faces a budget shortfall of more than $1 million.

#  Jeff City Rejects Casino Proposal 

Jeff City Council voted down a proposal to build a $165 million casino and hotel development. The proposal would have brought 900 jobs to the area, but some residents were opposed to the project, citing concerns about traffic and crime. 

The company behind the casino proposal, Gateway Casino, says it's disappointed with the decision and is considering its options.

#  Jeff City Votes Against Casino Proposal 

Jeff City residents voted against a proposed casino on Tuesday. The measure was defeated by a vote of 550 to 505.

The casino would have been built by the Bozell company and would have included a 120-room hotel, a conference center, and a spa. The proposal also included plans for a 18-hole golf course.

The defeat of the casino proposal is seen as a major blow to the Bozell company, which has been trying to get approval for the casino for the past six years. 

In a statement released after the vote, Bozell said that it was disappointed in the decision, but planned to continue work on its other projects in Jeff City.

#  No Casino Coming to Jefferson City

A local effort to bring a casino to Jefferson City has failed. The proposal, which would have seen a casino built in the northeast part of the city, was voted down by the Missouri Gaming Commission late last week.

The commission rejected the proposal because it did not meet the requirements set forth in state law. The proposed casino would have needed to generate at least $2 million per year in tax revenue for the state in order to be approved.

The proposal’s backers had argued that the casino would create jobs and bring tourism dollars to the area, but they were unable to win over enough of the commission’s members.

This is not the first time that a casino proposal has failed in Jefferson City. Another effort, which would have seen a casino built near Highway 54, was defeated in 2009.
