#  Precisely how old was Liverpool FC in Casino Royale? 

Liverpool FC were founded on 15th March 1892, so in the 2006 Casino Royale film they would have been 114 years old. The club reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time in their history in 2006, which they lost 2-1 to West Ham United.

#  How did Liverpool FC do in the movie? 

Liverpool Football Club, also known as Liverpool FC, is a professional football club in Liverpool, England. The club was founded in 1892 and competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Liverpool is one of the most successful clubs in English football, having won eighteen league titles, seven FA Cups and a record five European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles.

The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone".

Formed in 1892, Liverpool F.C. is one of the world's most iconic and successful football clubs. The Reds have won eighteen league titles - a haul that puts them fourth on England's all-time list - together with seven FA Cups and a record five UEFA Champions League trophies. 

From its early beginnings at Anfield to its current home at Anfield Road, Liverpool has always been one of Europe's leading clubs both on and off the pitch. Their commitment to attacking football and their passionate fanbase has created an unrivaled atmosphere at home games which other teams can only dream of replicating. 

In 2006, Fenway Sports Group (FSG) became the new owners of Liverpool FC and they have since worked tirelessly to restore the club to its former glory while also ensuring its long-term financial stability. Thanks to their efforts, Liverpool are now considered one of the biggest clubs in world football and they continue to break new ground both on and off the pitch. 

2018/19 was another memorable season for The Reds as they finished runners-up in the Premier League behind Manchester City while also reaching the UEFA Champions League final for the second consecutive year. However, they ultimately fell short against Spanish giants Barcelona as they lost 3-1 at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. Despite this heart-breaking defeat, Liverpool can be proud of their extraordinary achievements over the past two seasons and there is no doubt that they will be among the favourites to win next year's UEFA Champions League title.

#  Who were some of the players on the Liverpool FC team in Casino Royale? 

The 2006 film Casino Royale featured a star-studded cast, including Daniel Craig as James Bond and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. But the Liverpool FC team also had a few players make appearances in the movie. 

Most notably, Robbie Fowler played a minor role in the film as one of Bond's poker opponents. Fowler was an English striker who played for Liverpool from 1993 to 2001, and again from 2006 to 2007. He is currently the manager of Australian club Brisbane Roar. 

In addition to Fowler, other Liverpool players who appeared in Casino Royale include Jerzy Dudek, Steve Finnan, and John Arne Riise. Dudek was the goalkeeper for Liverpool from 2001 to 2006, Finnan played for the club from 2003 to 2008, and Riise was with Liverpool from 2001 to 2008. 

The contributions of these players helped make Casino Royale one of the most successful Bond movies ever made. And while they may not have been able to help Liverpool win any major trophies during their time with the club, they can at least take pride in knowing that they starred in one of the most iconic Bond films ever made.

#  Did any of the other teams in Casino Royale have a player that was older than Liverpool FC's oldest player? 

Liverpool FC's oldest player, 38-year-old Jamie Carragher, was the only player on any of the other teams in Casino Royale to be older than their team's oldest player. 

The next oldest player in the film was Emmanuel Petit of Paris Saint-Germain, who was just 34 years old. 

After Carragher, the next oldest players were Newcastle United's Shay Given (36 years old) and Birmingham City's Julian Gray (35 years old). 

Interestingly, all of the other players on Liverpool FC's team were significantly younger than Carragher. Their youngest player was 21-year-old Robbie Fowler.

#  What did Liverpool FC think of their experience in Casino Royale?

Liverpool FC were recently in Casino Royale and had a great experience. They thought the casino was well-run and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The players enjoyed the games, and the food and drinks were excellent. They would definitely recommend Casino Royale to anyone looking for a fun evening out.
