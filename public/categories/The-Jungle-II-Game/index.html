		<h1 id="Liverpool-FC-to-Rent-Belle-Isle-Casino-for-£10-000-Per-Game"><a href="#Liverpool-FC-to-Rent-Belle-Isle-Casino-for-£10-000-Per-Game" class="headerlink" title="Liverpool FC to Rent Belle Isle Casino for £10,000 Per Game"></a>Liverpool FC to Rent Belle Isle Casino for £10,000 Per Game</h1><p>Liverpool FC owner John W. Henry is renting out Belle Isle Casino for £10,000 a game as the team prepares to move into their new stadium, reports say.</p>
<p>The move is intended to bring in some much-needed extra revenue for the historic club. The rental agreement reportedly stipulates that the casino must be cleared of all its gambling machines and furniture for each game, which is expected to take around 12 hours.</p>
<p>Henry’s decision to rent out the casino is being seen as a sign that he is feeling the pressure to turn things around for Liverpool, who have not won a trophy since 2012. The team finished in 4th place in the Premier League last season, their lowest position in recent years.</p>
<p>Revenue from ticket sales has been declining in recent years, and Liverpool’s new stadium - which is set to open this year - is said to be costing the club around £200 million. Renting out Belle Isle Casino is thought to be one of Henry’s attempts to offset some of those costs.</p>
<p>The club has not yet announced which games will be played at the casino, but it is expected that they will use it for high-profile fixtures such as cup games and big Premier League matches.</p>
<h1 id="Liverpool-FC-to-Rent-Belle-Isle-Casino-as-3rd-Home-Ground"><a href="#Liverpool-FC-to-Rent-Belle-Isle-Casino-as-3rd-Home-Ground" class="headerlink" title="Liverpool FC to Rent Belle Isle Casino as 3rd Home Ground"></a>Liverpool FC to Rent Belle Isle Casino as 3rd Home Ground</h1><p>Liverpool FC has announced today that it will be renting Belle Isle Casino as its third home ground for the 2019-2020 season. The move, which is pending approval from the English Football Association, would see Anfield and Bramall Lane host home fixtures while the casino hosts away fixtures.</p>
<p>“This is an innovative move for Liverpool FC and a first for English football,” said club spokesman Philip Garrido. “Belle Isle Casino is a world-class facility with ample space to accommodate our fans, and its location in the heart of downtown Detroit will make it accessible to supporters from all over North America.”</p>
<p>The proposed agreement between Liverpool FC and Belle Isle Casino calls for the casino to be used as a training ground as well as a home ground. “We are very excited about this opportunity,” said Liverpool FC manager Jürgen Klopp. “The facilities at Belle Isle Casino are top-notch, and I know our players will appreciate having a world-class training ground right at their doorstep.”</p>
<p>While club officials say they are still awaiting final confirmation from the English Football Association, they are optimistic that the proposal will be approved. “We believe this is a win-win situation for both Liverpool FC and Belle Isle Casino,” said Garrido. “Our supporters will have an amazing experience watching us play at one of the world’s finest casinos, and Belle Isle Casino will benefit from the exposure and added revenue that comes with being home to an internationally renowned football club.”</p>
<h1 id="Belle-Isle-Casino-Chosen-as-Temporary-Home-of-Liverpool-FC"><a href="#Belle-Isle-Casino-Chosen-as-Temporary-Home-of-Liverpool-FC" class="headerlink" title="Belle Isle Casino Chosen as Temporary Home of Liverpool FC"></a>Belle Isle Casino Chosen as Temporary Home of Liverpool FC</h1><p>The Liverpool Football Club has announced that they will be playing their home games at the Belle Isle Casino in Detroit, Michigan for the next two months. The team’s CEO, Rick Parry, released a statement saying that they were grateful to the casino for offering them a temporary home.</p>
<p>The team’s relocation is due to the reconstruction of their stadium, Anfield, which is currently taking place. The project, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, will increase the stadium’s capacity from 45,000 to 60,000.</p>
<p>The Belle Isle Casino is a popular tourist destination and was recently named one of the “Top 10 Casinos in the World” by Travel + Leisure magazine. It is also home to several world-class restaurants, including Wolfgang Puck’s Spago and Michael Mina’s Stonefish.</p>
<h1 id="Liverpool-FC-to-Play-at-Belle-Isle-Casino-in-Upcoming-Games"><a href="#Liverpool-FC-to-Play-at-Belle-Isle-Casino-in-Upcoming-Games" class="headerlink" title="Liverpool FC to Play at Belle Isle Casino in Upcoming Games"></a>Liverpool FC to Play at Belle Isle Casino in Upcoming Games</h1><p>Liverpool FC, one of the most famous and successful soccer clubs in the world, will be playing a couple of exhibition games at the Belle Isle Casino in Detroit this summer. The games, which have not yet been announced, are scheduled to take place on July 23rd and 25th.</p>
<p>The casino is located on an island in the Detroit River and features a number of restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues. It is owned and operated by the city of Detroit.</p>
<p>Liverpool FC is no stranger to playing in North America. The club has played numerous exhibition games in both Canada and the United States over the years. Their last game in Detroit was in 2009 when they took on AC Milan at Ford Field.</p>
<p>According to a statement from Liverpool FC officials, the club is excited to be coming back to Detroit and looks forward to playing in front of its fans. They also thanked the casino for its hospitality and for providing a great venue for the game.</p>
<p>Details about the game, including ticket prices and how to purchase them, will be released at a later date.</p>
<h1 id="Belle-Isle-Casino-to-Play-Host-to-Liverpool-Football-Club"><a href="#Belle-Isle-Casino-to-Play-Host-to-Liverpool-Football-Club" class="headerlink" title="Belle Isle Casino to Play Host to Liverpool Football Club"></a>Belle Isle Casino to Play Host to Liverpool Football Club</h1><p>’s Preparation for U.S. Tour</p>
<p>Liverpool Football Club will take on Borussia Dortmund at Detroit’s Belle Isle Casino as part of their preparation for their highly anticipated U.S. tour this summer. The match is scheduled for July 19th, just days before the start of Liverpool’s tour, which will see them face off against three other top European sides in the International Champions Cup (ICC).</p>
<p>The game against Dortmund is seen as a key warm-up for Liverpool, as they gear up to take on some of the best teams in world football. Manager Juergen Klopp is no doubt eager to put his side through their paces, and what better place to do that than in the casinos of Detroit?</p>
<p>Belle Isle Casino is home to a number of top-quality sporting venues, including a 9-hole golf course, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, and a variety of tennis courts. It’s also the perfect location for football fans, with a number of sports bars and restaurants on site. So if you’re in Detroit during July, be sure to check out Belle Isle Casino and see some of the best teams in world football in action!</p>

		<h1 id="When-Did-Jefferson-City-MO-Vote-To-Certainly-Not-Put-Casino"><a href="#When-Did-Jefferson-City-MO-Vote-To-Certainly-Not-Put-Casino" class="headerlink" title="When Did Jefferson City MO Vote To Certainly Not Put Casino?"></a>When Did Jefferson City MO Vote To Certainly Not Put Casino?</h1><p>Although support for legal gambling is usually bipartisan, a vote to introduce casino gambling was anything but on Tuesday when the Missouri House of Representatives voted 112-44 not to put the issue on the ballot in November.</p>
<p>The issue pitted rural lawmakers who said casinos would provide a much-needed economic boost against those in urban areas who warned of addiction and social ills.</p>
<p>“I think it just creates a lot of problems in our state that we really don’t need,” Republican Rep. Mary Nichols, who represents Jefferson City, said after the vote. “We’ve got enough problems with casinos that are already here.”</p>
<p>Casinos are currently allowed only in Kansas City, St. Louis and in Branson. The amendment would have asked voters to approve up to six new casinos, with one each in St. Charles County, north of St. Louis; Buchanan County, which includes the tourist town of Kansas City; Cole County, home to Jefferson City and the University of Missouri; Greene County, including Springfield; Jackson County, including Kansas City; and Platte County on the Kansas border. </p>
<p>Jefferson City is opposed to a casino because it would bring more competition to an already saturated market while not providing any additional benefits to the city or its residents.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Proposal-Rejected-in-Jefferson-City"><a href="#Casino-Proposal-Rejected-in-Jefferson-City" class="headerlink" title="Casino Proposal Rejected in Jefferson City"></a>Casino Proposal Rejected in Jefferson City</h1><p>A proposal to allow casinos in Jefferson City was rejected by the city council this week. The vote was six against and two in favor of the proposal, which would have allowed for a single casino in the city. </p>
<p>Supporters of the casino argued that it would bring much-needed revenue to the city, while opponents raised concerns about increased crime and gambling addiction. The two council members who voted in favor of the proposal were both Republicans, while the six who voted against it were all Democrats. </p>
<p>The issue is likely to come up again in future discussions, as the city faces a budget shortfall of more than $1 million.</p>
<h1 id="Jeff-City-Rejects-Casino-Proposal"><a href="#Jeff-City-Rejects-Casino-Proposal" class="headerlink" title="Jeff City Rejects Casino Proposal"></a>Jeff City Rejects Casino Proposal</h1><p>Jeff City Council voted down a proposal to build a $165 million casino and hotel development. The proposal would have brought 900 jobs to the area, but some residents were opposed to the project, citing concerns about traffic and crime. </p>
<p>The company behind the casino proposal, Gateway Casino, says it’s disappointed with the decision and is considering its options.</p>
<h1 id="Jeff-City-Votes-Against-Casino-Proposal"><a href="#Jeff-City-Votes-Against-Casino-Proposal" class="headerlink" title="Jeff City Votes Against Casino Proposal"></a>Jeff City Votes Against Casino Proposal</h1><p>Jeff City residents voted against a proposed casino on Tuesday. The measure was defeated by a vote of 550 to 505.</p>
<p>The casino would have been built by the Bozell company and would have included a 120-room hotel, a conference center, and a spa. The proposal also included plans for a 18-hole golf course.</p>
<p>The defeat of the casino proposal is seen as a major blow to the Bozell company, which has been trying to get approval for the casino for the past six years. </p>
<p>In a statement released after the vote, Bozell said that it was disappointed in the decision, but planned to continue work on its other projects in Jeff City.</p>
<h1 id="No-Casino-Coming-to-Jefferson-City"><a href="#No-Casino-Coming-to-Jefferson-City" class="headerlink" title="No Casino Coming to Jefferson City"></a>No Casino Coming to Jefferson City</h1><p>A local effort to bring a casino to Jefferson City has failed. The proposal, which would have seen a casino built in the northeast part of the city, was voted down by the Missouri Gaming Commission late last week.</p>
<p>The commission rejected the proposal because it did not meet the requirements set forth in state law. The proposed casino would have needed to generate at least $2 million per year in tax revenue for the state in order to be approved.</p>
<p>The proposal’s backers had argued that the casino would create jobs and bring tourism dollars to the area, but they were unable to win over enough of the commission’s members.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino proposal has failed in Jefferson City. Another effort, which would have seen a casino built near Highway 54, was defeated in 2009.</p>
