		<h1 id="States-Where-Sports-Betting-is-Legal"><a href="#States-Where-Sports-Betting-is-Legal" class="headerlink" title="States Where Sports Betting is Legal"></a>States Where Sports Betting is Legal</h1><p>The United States is a patchwork of laws governing sports betting. Each state has the ability to create its own set of rules and regulations, making it a confusing landscape for bettors.</p>
<p>To help make sense of it all, we’ve put together a comprehensive list of states where sports betting is now legal, as well as those where it’s expected to be legalized in the near future.</p>
<p>For now, here are the states where you can legally place a sports bet:</p>
<p>Alaska<br>Arizona<br>Arkansas<br>California<br>Colorado<br>Connecticut<br>Delaware<br>Florida<br>Hawaii<br>Illinois<br>Indiana<br>Iowa<br>Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming </p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Opens-First-State-Licensed-Sportsbook"><a href="#Delaware-Opens-First-State-Licensed-Sportsbook" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Opens First State-Licensed Sportsbook"></a>Delaware Opens First State-Licensed Sportsbook</h1><p>Delaware has long been a gambling hotbed, with casinos dotting the map of the small state. But up until this week, sports betting was only legal in Delaware if you did it illegally. That changed on Tuesday when Delaware became the first state to offer legal sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban in May.</p>
<p>You can now place bets at three state-licensed locations: Harrington Raceway and Casino, Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, and Delaware Park Racetrack and Casino. The minimum bet is $1, and you can bet on games from any sport that has a professional or college team.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to offer this new product to our customers,” said Delaware Lottery Director Vernon Kirk in a statement. “We’ve been preparing for legalized sports betting for months and are confident that we are offering a product that will be both entertaining and profitable for Delawareans.”</p>
<p>The first day of legal sports betting in Delaware was a success, with over $380,000 wagered. And sports betting is expected to bring in big bucks for the state; according to one estimate, it could generate as much as $5 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling lucky, head on over to Delaware and place a bet!</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Move-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#More-States-Move-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="More States Move to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>More States Move to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>In the aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a federal ban on sports betting, several more states have taken steps to legalize the activity. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, and West Virginia have all passed legislation to allow sports betting within their borders, and Pennsylvania is expected to follow suit in the near future.</p>
<p>This represents a major shift in how Americans view sports betting. Just a few years ago, most people considered it to be a taboo activity that should be kept out of the mainstream. But with more and more states moving to legalize it, that perception is starting to change.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this change in attitude. For one thing, the legalization of sports betting could generate millions of dollars in revenue for state governments. In addition, it could create thousands of new jobs in the gambling industry. And finally, it would give people a chance to engage in what is traditionally seen as an enjoyable pastime.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that the legalization of sports betting is inevitable. It may take a few years for all 50 states to fully legalize it, but eventually it will happen. And when it does, it will bring about major changes in how Americans view gambling and sports.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Gambling-is-Now-Legal-in-8-States"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-is-Now-Legal-in-8-States" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling is Now Legal in 8 States"></a>Sports Gambling is Now Legal in 8 States</h1><p>Since the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May of 2018, sports gambling has been legalized in eight states. These states are Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and New York.</p>
<p>The repeal of PASPA was a major victory for the gaming industry. The law barred states from authorizing sports gambling and was enacted in 1992. The successful challenge to PASPA was brought by New Jersey and was led by former Gov. Chris Christie.</p>
<p>States that have since legalized sports gambling have seen a boost in tax revenue. In New Jersey, for example, gaming taxes on sports betting totaled $33 million in the first year after legalization. This is up from the $0.5 million collected from casino taxes in the state prior to legalization of sports betting.</p>
<p>In addition to tax revenue, legalized sports gambling has created jobs and spurred economic development in the states where it is legal. For example, the West Virginia Lottery commission reports that there are now 400 people working in the state’s new sports betting industry.</p>
<p>While 8 states have legalized sports gambling since PASPA was repealed, there are still many others that have yet to do so. This is largely due to opposition from leagues like the NFL and NBA. These leagues argue that legalizing sports gambling could lead to widespread game-fixing and other integrity issues.</p>
<p>Despite this opposition, momentum seems to be building for legalized sports gambling at the federal level. In October of 2018 a bill was introduced in Congress that would legalize sports betting nationwide. If passed, this bill would be a major victory for the gaming industry.</p>
<h1 id="Legal-Sports-Betting-Could-be-Coming-to-a-State-Near-You"><a href="#Legal-Sports-Betting-Could-be-Coming-to-a-State-Near-You" class="headerlink" title="Legal Sports Betting Could be Coming to a State Near You"></a>Legal Sports Betting Could be Coming to a State Near You</h1><p>In May of 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down a law that prohibited sports betting outside of Nevada. The 1992 law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), blocked 46 states from legalizing and regulating sports betting.</p>
<p>The repeal of PASPA opens up the possibility for states to enact their own legislation regulating sports betting. So far, a few states have taken action, with more expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>Which States Have Legalized Sports Betting?</p>
<p>As of July 2018, six states have legalized sports betting: Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Some other states are in the process of legalizing it.</p>
<p>How Does Sports Betting Work?</p>
<p>Sports betting usually occurs at casinos or online through a website or app. You place a bet on a particular game or outcome and then wait for the game to finish to see if you win or lose your bet. Winnings are paid out depending on the odds offered by the bookmaker.</p>
<p>Types of Bets You Can Place</p>
<p>There are a variety of bets that you can place on a sporting event. The most common are listed below:</p>
<p>· Moneyline bet: A bet on who will win the game outright. The favorite will have a negative number next to their name (e.g., -180),<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> while the underdog will have a positive number next to their name (+120). To win a moneyline bet, you need to bet on the favored team and they must win by more than the point spread (the margin of victory). If they win by exactly the point spread, your bet is refunded. </p>
<p>· Point spread bet: A bet on whether the favored team will win by more or less than the point spread set by the bookmaker. </p>
<p>· Over&#x2F;under bet: A bet on whether the total points scored in a game will be over or under a certain number set by the bookmaker. </p>
<p>· Proposition (prop) bet: A prop bet is a wager on something other than who will win or lose the game outright. This could be anything from who will score first to how many yellow cards will be shown in total. </p>
<p>All of these bets can also be placed as singles or multiples (parlays).</p>
