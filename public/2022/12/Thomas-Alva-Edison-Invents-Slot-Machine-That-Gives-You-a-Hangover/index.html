	  <h1 id="Thomas-Alva-Edison-Invents-Slot-Machine-That-Gives-You-a-Hangover"><a href="#Thomas-Alva-Edison-Invents-Slot-Machine-That-Gives-You-a-Hangover" class="headerlink" title="Thomas Alva Edison Invents Slot Machine That Gives You a Hangover"></a>Thomas Alva Edison Invents Slot Machine That Gives You a Hangover</h1><p>In 1894, Thomas Alva Edison invented the slot machine. It was marketed as a “sensation” and for good reason: it quickly became popular among casino-goers for its unique ability to give you a hangover.</p>
<p>At the time, no one had ever seen anything like it. The slot machine consisted of three spinning reels, each with 10 symbols. Players would insert a coin and pull the lever, which would cause the reels to spin. If the player landed on three matching symbols, they would win the corresponding prize.</p>
<p>The slot machine was an instant hit, but it also had some major drawbacks. First and foremost, it was incredibly addictive. Players could easily lose hours at a time playing slots, and many ended up with nasty hangovers as a result.</p>
<p>Secondly, the machines were prone to malfunctioning. This often led to players winning nothing despite repeated attempts.</p>
<p>Despite these drawbacks, the slot machine remained popular throughout the early 20th century. It wasn’t until the 1950s that it began to fall out of favour, due in part to stricter gambling laws and the rise of video games.</p>
<p>Today, while Slot Machines are still found in some casinos, they have largely been replaced by online gambling games like poker and blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="Edison’s-Latest-Invention-The-Hangover-Game-Slot-Machine"><a href="#Edison’s-Latest-Invention-The-Hangover-Game-Slot-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Edison’s Latest Invention: The Hangover Game Slot Machine"></a>Edison’s Latest Invention: The Hangover Game Slot Machine</h1><p>Inventor Thomas Edison is at it again, this time with a new invention that he claims can cure hangovers. The Hangover Game Slot Machine debuted at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The machine is a regular slot machine with three reels and five pay lines, but it has a special feature that gives players a chance to win free spins or credits if they hit three hangover symbols on the pay line.</p>
<p>Edison says that the machine was designed to help people who drink too much, but he also thinks it will be popular with casino gamblers. “I think this will be a big hit with people who like to gamble,” Edison said. “It’s a fun way to try and win some free credits.”</p>
<p>Edison says he got the idea for the machine after seeing how popular hangover drinks are. “People are always looking for cures for their hangovers, so I thought this would be a great way to offer them some relief.”</p>
<p>The Hangover Game Slot Machine is expected to be released later this year.</p>
