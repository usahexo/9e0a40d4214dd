The term “Jungle” is used to describe the starting location where the players land. This can be anything from a wide open space to a dense forest. </p>
<p>The next area after the Jungle is called the “Castle.” This is where players will find themselves battling it out against each other in hopes of taking control of the castle and becoming the victor.

But what is the name for the object used to play this game?</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are many names for the object used to play Jungle II. These include; knucklebones, Jacks, jacks, Chinese checkers, hobbles, and graces. Of these names, Jungle II is typically known as jacks.</p>
<p>Jacks is a game that has been around for centuries. It is thought to have originated in Europe and was brought over to America by settlers. The game is believed to have been popular with sailors due to its portability.</p>
<p>To play jacks, you will need a set of jacks (or knucklebones), which are small objects made from bone, metal, or plastic. The game can be played by any number of players and can be enjoyed indoors or outdoors.</p>
<p>The goal of jacks is to collect as many objects as possible and then return them to your base. Players take turns tossing the jacks into the air and then catching them. If you drop one of the jacks, you must pick it up before you can continue playing. The player who collects the most objects wins the game.</p>
<p>Jacks can be played with any number of players, but is typically played with two people. To begin the game, each player takes six of the jacks and places them in front of them so that they are facing their opponent. The player who tossed the jacks last begins the next round by tossing them into the air and catching them again.</p>
<p>If you want to add a little bit of excitement to the game, you can also play “jail”. In jail, players must put one hand behind their back whenever they catch a jack. If they drop a jack, they must go to jail. The first player to get all four of their jacks back to their base wins the game.</p>
